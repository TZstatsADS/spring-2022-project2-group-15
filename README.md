+ **Project summary**: COVID-19 has affected people's daily life a lot. Living in the City of New York, we have so many choices to enjoy our leisure time while at the same time we should try to keep ourselves and our community safe. To help our New Yorkers who want not only to enjoy their spare time, but also to protect themselves from the epidemic, we created this webpage to know about all the kinds of events happened in the 5 boroughs in NYC in recent years, and made a comparison between the count of different types of events before and during COVID using map to visualize. What's more, we can receive up-to-date COVID information about the areas where they want to go. In a word, our shiny app is aimed at helping all of us live in New York City safely at the same time making our life enjoyable.
